# Note:
> Currently the github action is only configured to run on weekdays that is Mon - Fri at 9:30 am and 6:30 pm so you will get punched in at 9:30 and will be punched out at 6:30 pm.


## Then how to run it when you are working on Holidays/Weekends ?
- You can use the app on your phone or desktop to do the Punch In/Out (**the boring way!!!!**)
- Or you can run the workflow manually on the github repo (i know it is a bit long ðŸ˜…)
- Or if you want to use github-cli (gh) 

  - It is a one time thing to do
    ```shell
    brew install gh
    gh auth login
    ```
    Complete the Authentication part

  - Then just clone the repo to your local and go into the directory and then run the below command
    ```shell
    gh workflow run 
    ```
    Select the github workflow and you are done
